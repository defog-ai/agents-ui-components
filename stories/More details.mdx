There's three main components you can use as exports from this library. The three components, in increasing level of complexity are:

- `AnalysisAgent`: Renders a single analysis. This requires the least amount of configuration.
- `AnalysisTreeViewer`: A "Tree" of analyses. This requires most of the similar props, but the analyses are now in a tree structure.
- `DefogAnalysisAgentEmbed`: The most complex component, this is a full analysis viewer. It includes the tree, the analysis, and the ability to navigate between datasets. Also allows for CSV uploading and querying that using a sqlite database.

For usage examples, look in the Quickstart doc.

A crucial component of getting analyses to work is the `Setup` component. You will need this when using the first two components, while `DefogAnalysisAgentEmbed` will handle it for you internally.

The `Setup` component wraps around your content, and handles the setup of the tools and initialises a sqlite db.

You be able to pass it all the available options for the _agent's configuration_. This configuration has the following options, some of these are user auth related, others are related to the agent's UI look:

<ConfigTable />

Before you get to running your analysis, you will have a database defined somewhere, and also what you can/cannot allow for that database. For the purpose of these docs, let's say these are our two dbs. This is also the general format all components use for the databases.

<div className="text-gray-500 whitespace-pre !text-sm !font-mono !my-4 !p-2 bg-gray-50">
  {JSON.stringify(sampleDbs, null, 4)}
</div>

The `isTemp` field is used to determine if the database is temporary or not. This is always true for CSV databases, otherwise false.

The `sqlOnly` field is used to determine if the database is only for single step SQL analysis, and not "advanced" aka multi-step agent analysis.
