# Introduction

## Endpoints

Currently the agents UI is very tightly coupled with our [agents REST endpoints](https://github.com/defog-ai/defog-self-hosted/tree/main/backend/agent_routes.py).

## Basic agent "steps"

Before going into code, it's probably helpful to know the agent currently has a three step process:

- **Clarifier**: This is where the agent will ask for clarity from the user if the question is unclear.

<Image src={"./assets/frontend/clarifier.png"} />

- **Clarifier post processing**: When the user sends over their answers, our responses are still in a "Question/Answer" format. We want to convert these into statements that we can put in our prompt later on. So we run a `generate_assignment_understanding` function which calls our `/turn_into_statements` [endpoint](https://github.com/defog-ai/defog-backend-python/tree/main/server/agent_routes.py#L272).

  We call this resulting piece of text `assignment_understanding`. We will store it in the db and later put it into our prompt to help the model have more context about the user's question. We store in the db because we don't want to repeatedly call an LLM to generate these statements for all step, but only for the first step.

- **Planner**: This will finally convert the user question into a plan containing multiple executable steps using tools.

  Using the `assignment_understanding` above, we call our `/generate_step` endpoint, which runs the `generate_single_step` [function](https://github.com/defog-ai/defog-self-hosted/blob/main/backend/agents/planner_executor/planner_executor_agent.py#L536-L549). This takes in the current steps, and returns the next step.

# Code walkthrough

## Frontend

### analysisManager

Probably the most important piece of this repo - the [analysisManager](https://github.com/defog-ai/agents-ui-components/tree/main/lib/components/agent/analysis/analysisManager.js). This manages the agent workflow. It is responsible for:

- Maintaining internal state of the analysis's data.
- Calling the backend when needed for new data: clarifying, step generation etc.
- Receiving the new data and updating the analysis data.

For reference, this is what the analysis data looks like for a completed analysis with the user question: "show me 5 rows". You can click this and expand it to see the full data.

<div className="p-3 bg-gray-50 border">
  <ReactJson src={sampleAnalysisData} collapsed={2} />
</div>

<Note
  classNames="my-4"
  text={
    "This is the exact format the data is stored on the backend in a postgres table too."
  }
/>

The `analysisManager` _has no UI role_. Instead, in order to keep logic and UI separate, it provides [subscribe methods](https://github.com/defog-ai/agents-ui-components/blob/main/lib/components/agent/analysis/analysisManager.js#L730-L736), where a listener can subscribe to changes in analysis data.

<Image src={"./assets/frontend/subscribe.png"} code />

The listener will then be called [anytime analysis's data changes. Note the `emitDataChange()` call below. ](https://github.com/defog-ai/agents-ui-components/tree/main/lib/components/agent/analysis/analysisManager.js#L130-L136)

<Image src={"./assets/frontend/emit.png"} code />

### AnalysisAgent

Here is where the [AnalysisAgent.jsx](https://github.com/defog-ai/agents-ui-components/tree/main/lib/components/agent/analysis/AnalysisAgent.jsx#L39) comes in. This is what constructs the UI of the agent, from the data stored in analysis manager. It uses React's `useSyncExternalStore` hook, which internally just calls the above `subscribeToDataChanges` method.

<Image src={"./assets/frontend/useSync.png"} code />

Note that each analysis has [its own analysis manager](https://github.com/defog-ai/agents-ui-components/tree/main/lib/components/agent/analysis/AnalysisAgent.jsx#L186-L203) that is created when the component mounts.

### User submit code walkthrough

When a user types a question and presses submit, we first go to the [handleSubmit](https://github.com/defog-ai/agents-ui-components/blob/main/lib/components/agent/analysis/AnalysisAgent.jsx#L265-L285) function of the AnalysisAgent. Which is a very thin wrapper around the analysis manager's own `submit` function. The only extra thing it does is set the loading state, and add error handling.

Then it will call analysis manager's [submit](https://github.com/defog-ai/agents-ui-components/blob/main/lib/components/agent/analysis/analysisManager.js#L312) function.

The manager's submit function sends a request to the backend, after constructing the request body. The crucial part of the body is the `request_type` parameter. This describes what we are asking the agent to do. This is what the backend looks at and runs the correct functions. If we're asking for clarifications, this is `clarify` and if we're asking for a plan, this is `gen_steps`.

The manager will keep sending a request to the backend till a `done` parameter in the response is true or we get an `error_message` in the response. This is how we know we're done generating the plan.

It will then check if there is an `error_message` in the response, if so, it will throw an error. If it's an error, we will immediately go into the `catch` block, and send over the response to the UI (`AnalysisAgent.jsx`). If the stage's data was empty, we just _delete_ that stage so that we don't end up showing some blank state in the UI.

<Image src="./assets/frontend/res-error.png" code />

If the response is successful, and there is no error, When the manager calls the `mergeNewDataToAnalysis` [function](https://github.com/defog-ai/agents-ui-components/blob/main/lib/components/agent/analysis/analysisManager.js#L425).

- It will either overwrite the data or merge incoming data the existing analysis data. Not going into details of that, but it's only mildly convoluted and lives [here](https://github.com/defog-ai/agents-ui-components/blob/main/lib/components/agent/analysis/analysisManager.js#L454-L482).
- finally, we send our response back to

## Backend

Most of the logic for our backend can be understood by looking at the endpoints in [agent_routes.py](https://github.com/defog-ai/defog-self-hosted/blob/main/backend/agent_routes.py)
